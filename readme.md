#IMPORTANT: The extension-entry "Tab Manager" in the chrome web store has been sold and I am no longer the owner! Neither do I know the source code of the version that currently gets deployed through the web store.

Please note that only the web store entry and no source code has been sold. I, and all contributors of the project, are still the owners of the source code. Everyone is free to publish its own version of Tab Manager to the chrome web store. I recommend using a different name, though. Feel free to fork & improve this project at your will.

# Tab Manager
This is a Google Chrome extension which allows you to easily and quickly manage and access your tabs/windows ;)
Have fun with it!
